### Risk

Human beings have provided some form of insurance to one another for at least
as long as recorded time (.e.g. [@bogucki11]), and the modern
world is full of institutional arrangements that protect individuals against
risk. One way way to derive demand for these institutions from an economic
model is to assume that individuals are inherently *risk averse* in the sense
that they are willing to pay something now in return for a more certain outcome
in the future. The *expected utility* model is a simple representation for this
sort of preference. In it, we assume that individuals can rank choices that
influence the probability distribution over uncertain future outcomes by
comparing the expected value of an increasing state-independent concave utility
function $u(\cdot)$ across choices.

Let's think about this, and how it m

#### Exercises

1. Compute certainty equivalent and draw picture.
1. Use different specific utility functions and draw picture.
1. Characterize expected-utility maximizing allocation.
1. Do the same numerically for more reasonable production technology
1. Examine numerically FOSD and SOSD of distrubtions.
1. Use distributions and utility function to compute range of profit maximizing
   and expected utility maximizing allocations.
1. Exercise: What is the farmer's willingness to pay for insurance?
