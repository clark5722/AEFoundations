### Exercises

> Most books first state a general theorem or apparatus, and then show how
applications are special cases of a grand general structure. That’s how we
organize things that we already know, but that’s not how we learn things. We
learn things by getting familiar with a bunch of examples, and then seeing how
they fit together in a more general framework. And the point is the "examples"
knowing how to do something.

>John Cochrane, Preface to "Time Series for Macroecnomics and Finance, 2005"

I stumbled across this quote by John Cochrane and can't agree more with his sentiment. Most textbooks really function better as reference books than learning material. The intent of the exercises I offer below is for you to explore problems. Read just enough to get started, and then dive in and get your hands dirty. You will have ample opportunity in future coursework to revisit and contemplate more deeply the underlying theory.
