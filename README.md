### Foundations of Agricultural Economics, AAE 641

**Instructor**: Brent Hueth

**Office Hours**: By appointment

#### Course Description

This course provides perspective on broad countours of the food and
agricultural economics field, including its historical development and current
active research themes. I highlight economic and policy interactions that
connect the field to related development, environment, and health fields. The
course also provides students an introduction to applied research methodology
with ample opportunity to conduct hands-on data analysis, and to explore the
variety of strategies used by economists to conduct applied research. Class
time is split between discussion and problem solving with discussion focused on
specific questions for which I will often ask students to prepare written
responses. Likewise, problems require a mix of analytic derivation, data
analysis, writing, and presentation.

#### Learning Objectives

1. Develop an appreciation for the historical antecedents and contemporary
   status of food and agricultural economics as a field, and for the full range
   of economic and policy interactions with related development, environment,
   and health fields.
1. Learn how to read academic papers critically: identify key assumptions,
   evaluate relevance and robustness of stated results, and assess extent of
   contribution in light of previous related work.
1. Gain a sense for the art of building simple mathematical models as aids to
   understanding social and economic behavior.
1. Appreciate the difference between a stylized economic model and a
   well-specified empirical model to be used for measurement, model testing,
   or policy analysis.
1. Understand the role of economic models as a source of identification in
   empirical models, and their value for conducting counterfactual policy
   analysis.
1. Develop best practice for conducting applied research using modern
   analytic, computing, data processing, version control, and publishing
   tools.

#### Assignments and Grading

- I will distribute at least one homework assignment per topic module.
- You will identify and replicate the results of one published research paper
  that is relevant to the theme of this course, and prepare a written report of your findings.
- I will ask you to prepare responses to questions I ask in anticipation of
  classroom discussion of published research.

Each of these assignments will carry roughly equal weight when I assign grades
for the class. You will be graded for correctness, completeness, and quality of
presentation. There will be no exams.
