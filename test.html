<h3 id="risk">Risk</h3>
<p>Human beings have provided some form of insurance to one another for at least as long as recorded time (e.g., <span class="citation">Bogucki (2011)</span>), and the modern world is full of institutional arrangements that protect individuals against risk. One way way to derive demand for these institutions from an economic model is to assume that individuals are inherently <em>risk averse</em> in the sense that they are willing to pay something now in return for a more certain outcome in the future. The <em>expected utility</em> model is a simple representation for this sort of preference. In it, we assume that individuals can rank choices that influence the probability distribution over uncertain future outcomes by comparing the expected value of an increasing state-independent concave utility function <span class="math">\(u(\cdot)\)</span> across choices.</p>
<p>Let's think about this, and how it m</p>

<li>Compute certainty equivalent and draw picture.</li>
<li>Use different specific utility functions and draw picture.</li>
