I highlight economic and policy interactions that\r\nconnect the field to related development, environment, and health fields. The\r\ncourse also provides students an introduction to applied research methodology\r\nwith ample opportunity to conduct hands-on data analysis, and to explore the\r\nvariety of strategies used by economists to conduct applied research. Class\r\ntime is split between discussion and problem solving with discussion focused on\r\nspecific questions for which I will often ask students to prepare written\r\nresponses. Likewise, problems require a mix of analytic derivation, data\r\nanalysis, writing, and presentation.\r\n\r\n#### Learning Objectives\r\n\r\n1. Develop an appreciation for the historical antecedents and contemporary\r\n   status of food and agricultural economics as a field, and for the full range\r\n   of economic and policy interactions with related development, environment,\r\n   and health fields.\r\n1. Learn how to read academic papers critically: identify key assumptions,\r\n   evaluate relevance and robustness of stated results, and assess extent of\r\n   contribution in light of previous related work.\r\n1. Gain a sense for the art of building simple mathematical models as aids to\r\n   understanding social and economic behavior.\r\n1. Appreciate the difference between a stylized economic model and a\r\n   well-specified empirical model to be used for measurement, model testing,\r\n   or policy analysis.\r\n1. Understand the role of economic models as a source of identification in\r\n   empirical models, and their value for conducting counterfactual policy\r\n   analysis.\r\n1. Develop best practice for conducting applied research using modern\r\n   analytic, computing, data processing, version control, and publishing\r\n   tools.\r\n\r\n#### [Course Outline and Readings](./course_outline.md)\r\n\r\n#### [Schedule](./schedule.md)\r\n\r\n#### Assignments and Grading\r\n\r\n- I will distribute at least one homework assignment per topic module.\r\n- You will identify and replicate the results of one published research paper\r\n  that is relevant to the theme of this course, and prepare a written report of your findings.\r\n- I will ask you to prepare responses to questions I ask in anticipation of\r\n  classroom discussion of published research.\r\n\r\nEach of these assignments will carry roughly equal weight when I assign grades\r\nfor the class. You will be graded for correctness, completeness, and quality of\r\npresentation. There will be no exams.\r\n\r\n#### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- [Tools and tips](./tools_tips.md)\r\n- [A note about economic models](./models.md)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
