In this course I provide perspective on broad countours of the food and
agricultural economics field, including its historical development and current
active research themes. I highlight economic and policy interactions that
connects the field to related development, environment, and health fields
within economics. The class also provides students an introduction to applied
research methodology with hands on data analysis and discussion of the varied
research strategies used by economists and other social scientists. In class, I
split time between discussion and problem solving. All discussion will,
however, be directed toward specific questions for which I will ask students to
prepare written responses. Likewise, problems require a mix of analytic
derivation, data analysis, writing, and presentation.
