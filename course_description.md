This course provides students perspective on the broad countours of the
agricultural economics field, including its historical development and current
active themes. I identify connections with related development, environment,
and health fields, and highlight important economic and policy interactions
with food and farming in each of these settings. Class time will be split
between discussion and problem solving. All discussion will, however, be
directed toward specific questions for which I will ask you to prepare written
responses. Likewise, problems will require a mix of analytic derivation, data
analysis, writing, and presentation.
