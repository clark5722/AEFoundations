This course provides students perspective on the broad countours of the
agricultural economics field, including its historical development and current
active themes. I identify connections with related economics fields
development, environment, and health, and draw out the important role that
agriculture plays in each of these settings. Class time will be split roughly equally between discussion and problem solving. All discussion will, however, be directed toward specific questions for which I will ask you to prepare written responses. Likewise, problems will require a mix of analytic derivation, data analysis, writing, and presentation.
