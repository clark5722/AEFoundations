Risk
~~~~

Human beings have provided some form of insurance to one another for at
least as long as recorded time (e.g., Bogucki (2011)), and the modern
world is full of institutional arrangements that protect individuals
against risk. One way way to derive demand for these institutions from
an economic model is to assume that individuals are inherently *risk
averse* in the sense that they are willing to pay something now in
return for a more certain outcome in the future. The *expected utility*
model is a simple representation for this sort of preference. In it, we
assume that individuals can rank choices that influence the probability
distribution over uncertain future outcomes by comparing the expected
value of an increasing state-independent concave utility function
:math:`u(\cdot)` across choices.

Let's think about this, and how it m

Exercises
^^^^^^^^^

1. Compute certainty equivalent and draw picture.
2. Use different specific utility functions and draw picture.
3. Characterize expected-utility maximizing allocation.
4. Do the same numerically for more reasonable production technology
5. Examine numerically FOSD and SOSD of distrubtions.
6. Use distributions and utility function to compute range of profit
   maximizing and expected utility maximizing allocations.
7. Exercise: What is the farmer's willingness to pay for insurance?
8. Calculate welfare gain from insurance.
9. Calculate certainty equivalent as a function of parameters.
