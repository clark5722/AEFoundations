This is a tentative outline and schedule for the topics we will cover. All readings can be found in our Zotero course library or through the campus library system.

To permit ample time for analysis and problem solving, I will not attempt anything near comprehensive coverage of the field. For this, you can consult the now massive [4 volume Handbook series on Agricultural Economics](http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/science/handbooks/15740072/4)  published by Elsevier. The first two volumes were edited by the late Bruce Gardner and Gordon Rausser, and the more recent two (focusing on economic develpment and trade) by Robert Evenson and Prabhu Pingali.

Instead, I will focus on a few key topics, and a small handful of papers within
each topic that I hope provide a representative sample of issues and research
designs that are typical in the field. My intent is that you read carefully
read each of the papers I assign. This is not a "kitchen-sink" reading list
representing a survey of the field (for that see the Handbook).

### Agricultural Economics Historical Overview

We will not discuss it in class, but I recommend highly reading this very nice
piece by Ford Runge on historical antecedents for the field.

- Runge, C. Ford. Agricultural Economics: A Brief Intellectual History. Staff
  Paper. University of Minnesota, Department of Applied Economics, 2006.

### Risk (2 weeks)

Moschini and Hennessy provide a nice overview of risk and uncertainty in economic decision making, including a brief, but informative development of expected utility theory. Read this first as background for our learning during this part of the course.

  Aversion, and Risk Management for Agricultural Producers.” In Handbook of

### Productivity (2 weeks)

Productivity is is where growth comes from. How do we measure it and determine
where it comes from?

  Theory and Statistical Measurement.” In Handbook of Agricultural Economics,

### Household Production (1 week)

Farming is still largely a family operation. We won't ask why for now, but we
will examine the consequences of "household production" for thinking about how
farmers behave as producers.

  Testing for Separation in Agricultural Household Models.” Econometrica 60,
