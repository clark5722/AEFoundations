<p>You will take courses from many professors while you here at the University of Wisconsin--Madison. Each will have their own style and toolkit for conducting applied research. It is up to you to decide what mix of tools best suites your needs, but in my experience you will do yourself a favor by investing now in learning <em>well</em> a few high-quality computational, version control, and writing tools. See <a href="http://brenthueth.net/post/100824459208/writing-tools">here</a> for a discussion of writing tools.</p>
<p>Here are a few pointers to computation and version-control resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git: This definitely requires an investment and involves some overhead, but I think the long-run payoffs can be significant. Aside from the tremendous functionality it provides for collaboration and reproducibility, you will benefit from using it yourself as a project-specific research notebook. <a href="http://nyuccl.org/pages/GitTutorial/">Here</a> is a gentle introduction with good links to additional resources.</li>
<li>Python/IPython: For this, I will direct you to the <a href="http://quant-econ.net/py/index.html">Quantitative Economics</a> page developed and maintained by Tom Sargent and John Stachurski, and to <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks">a gallery of interesting IPytyhon Notebooks</a>. There is no reason to code a complex estimation alogrithm that someone else has already coded, in which case occasionally you may want want to use <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. But for day-to-day computation, data handling, simulation or calibration, and estimation, you have all that you need in Python and friends.</li>
<li>Reproducability: Except in experiments, we cannot &quot;replicate&quot; scientific findings in the usual sense, but we should at least be able to <em>reproduce</em> each other's results using exactly the same data! That's why we need organizations like the <a href="http://openeconomics.net/">Open Economics Working Group</a>, and the <a href="http://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Replication in Economics Wiki</a>.</li>
<li>Experiments are increasingly used by economists for applied research, market design, and teaching. We will not cover experimental methods in this course, though we will discuss several experimental papers. <a href="http://www.otree.org/">Otree</a> is a great new tool (writtin in Python, of course!) for conducting experiments.</li>

<li>Often the hardest to part to writing a research paper is the introduction. Don Fullerton provides <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35757123/writing-general.pdf">a template</a> (scroll down a bit in the document for the Introduction-specific instructions) for structuring your introduction that works remarkably well. I suggest that for your first few research papers you follow this formula.</li>
<li>The importance of writing well in economics cannot be overemhpasized. Searching Google for &quot;writing economics&quot; turns up a whole host of great resources. I recommend that you take some time to read through some of these, and that you internalize their words of wisdom. I aslo highly recommend reading several times, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Economics-Donald-McCloskey/dp/0023795204">McCloskey's &quot;Writing of Economics.&quot;</a> I also recommend his Economic Inquiry article, &quot;Economical Writing&quot; that you can find in our class Zotero library.</li>
