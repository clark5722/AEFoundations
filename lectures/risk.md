### Risk

Human beings have provided some form of insurance to one another for at least
as long as recorded time (e.g., @bogucki_wealth_2011, @clare_pastoral_2010,
@trenerry_origin_1926), and the modern world is full of institutional
arrangements that protect individuals against risk. One way way to derive
demand for these institutions from an economic model is to assume that
individuals are inherently *risk averse* in the sense that they are willing to
pay something now in return for a more certain outcome in the future. The
*expected utility* model is a simple representation for this sort of
preference. In it, we assume that individuals can rank choices that influence
the probability distribution over uncertain future outcomes by comparing the
expected value of an increasing state-independent concave utility function
$u(\cdot)$ across choices.

Let's think about this, and how it m

#### Exercises

1. Use distributions and utility function to compute range of profit maximizing
   and expected utility maximizing allocations.
1. Exercise: What is the farmer's willingness to pay for insurance?
