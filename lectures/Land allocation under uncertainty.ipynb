      "Generate allocation choices for sample of heterogenous farmers based on individual-specific beliefs and low-level risk-aversion. Generate outcome from policy experiment that offers insurance. Let students measure \"impact\" from insurance program. How much did it change land allocation? What is the welfare gain from insurance? How much should we spend to subsidize program, and how much are farmers willing to pay for insurance? We have no idea because we don't the utility functions or the distributions. Can we estimate these things? How does this differ relative to *predicting* allocations based on farmer characteristics. Let's give each farmer a characteristic. This will allow us to use fixed effect plus common regressor for prediction.\n",
