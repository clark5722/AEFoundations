# Motivating question

1. Applied question for ag. economist: Are farm households "underinsured"? And
   if so, what should we do about it?
1. Let's think about an easier question: How can we assess potential benefits
   and efficacy of a subsidized insurance program?
1. There is lots that we need to know to tackle this question:
    - Theory behind risk and insurance; 
    - Data collection and meaurement;
    - Modeling (production, risk, households) and econometrics;
    - Farming and sources of risk mitigation
1. Lot's to learn, but we have to start somewhere! 
    - Let's start with decision making under uncertainty

# Uncertainty in economic analysis

- How we measure the cost of uncertainty?
- How does the presence of uncertainty influence behavior?
