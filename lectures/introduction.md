# Motivating question

- Present development policy scenario (see De Falco paper). 
- Let's think about what kinds of policy we might use in this setting, and what
  kind of analysis could we do to assess policy design.

# Uncertainty in economic analysis

- Discuss risk and uncertainty and how it complicates decision making.
- Discuss objective function, VN utility functions, and stochastic dominance.
- Discuss subtly in moving from VN utility to expected utility.
- Let's assume the farmer has VN utility $u$ and wants to maximize expected
  utility.
