<h2 id="course-topics-and-readings">Course Topics and Readings</h2>
<p>This is a tentative outline and schedule for the topics we will cover. All readings can be found in our Zotero course library or through the campus library system.</p>
<p>To permit ample time for analysis and problem solving, I will not attempt anything near comprehensive coverage of the field. For this, you can consult the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/science/handbooks/15740072/4">4 volume Handbook series on Agricultural Economics</a> published by Elsevier. The first two volumes were edited by the late Bruce Gardner and Gordon Rausser, and the more recent two (focusing on economic develpment and trade) by Robert Evenson and Prabhu Pingali.</p>
<p>Instead, I will focus on a few key topics, and a small handful of papers within each topic that I hope provide a representative sample of issues and research designs that are typical in the field. My intent is that you read carefully each of the papers I assign. This is not a &quot;kitchen-sink&quot; reading list representing a survey of the field (for that see the Handbook).</p>
<h3 id="agricultural-economics-historical-overview">Agricultural Economics Historical Overview</h3>
<p>We will not discuss it in class, but I recommend reading this very nice piece by Ford Runge on historical antecedents for the field.</p>

<h3 id="risk-2-weeks">Risk (2 weeks)</h3>
<p>Moschini and Hennessy provide a nice overview of risk and uncertainty in economic decision making, including a brief, but informative development of expected utility theory. Read this first as background for our learning during this part of the course.</p>
